1- Extract Elstar (v2.1.1).rar file.
2- Go to starter folder 
3- open vscode 
4- npm install reusify (first don't do it. if encountred error do this)
4- npm install
5- npm start

6- How it works
    Development: Uses http://localhost:8000 from .env.development → becomes http://localhost:8000/api/v1
    Production: Uses https://datilio.com from .env.production → becomes https://datilio.com/api/v1
    Vite automatically loads the appropriate .env file based on the mode 
    (npm run dev uses .env.development, npm run build uses .env.production).
    No linting errors. The configuration is ready to use.
